Hi there, this is my first learning project at The Odin Project.

Odin recipes is supposed to put all I've learn until now in practice with HTML Foundations.

Here are the topics covered:

- Elements and Tags

- HTML Boilerplate

- Working with text

- Lists

- Links and Images

The objective is create a website using plain HTML with some recipes. Each of them with their proper page, containing a heading, an image, description and two lists with ingredients and the steps needed.
